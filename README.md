## Getting started:

Make sure you have Docker open on your device before starting. Then, clone this repository and then reopen it in VS Code. You should see a prompt in the bottom right with a button to "Reopen in Container". Click that, and after some time you should be loaded into an instance of VS Code with everything you need!
